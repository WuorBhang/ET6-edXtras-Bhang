# Behavior, Strategy, Implementation

Practice distinguishing & describing a program's behavior, strategy and implementation. At a high level, your task is to:

1. **Behavior**: Run the program to understand its _behavior_. Document the code then rename the file.
2. **Implementation**: Read, step through, and study the code to understand its _implementation_.
3. **Strategy**: Rename the variables and add comments to describe the program's _strategy_.

There are two types of exercise (_programs_ and _algorithms_), each exercise is slightly different. For a detailed explanation of how to study the _programs_ read [Describing Programs](./describing_programs.md), to learn about describing functions study [Documenting and Testing](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-Programming-With-Python/tree/main/3_documenting_and_testing). There are stepped examples to study in `/examples`, the exercises contain uncommented programs with dummy variable names.

## Suggested Study

- [Variable Roles](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/01-review/10-variable-roles)
- [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) - An enormous collection of code to study!  This repository can be overwhelming so keep in mind: your Zone of Proximal Development, and One Thing at a Time.
