# Progressive Practice

Build up to writing your own _implementation_ of an example program by studying 3 different implementations:

- `0_reference.py`: An _obfuscated_ program - the code's _strategy_ and _implementation_ are impossible to understand, but it's _behavior_ is correct when you run it. You can run this program to understand what you are developing in the next exercises.
- `1_blanks.py`: A nearly complete implementation with some blanks (`__`) to fill in.  You can test your solution by comparing it to the `0_reference.py`.
- `2_bugs.py`: A buggy implementation of the reference program.  Fix the bugs!
- `3_goals.py`: An incomplete program with a large chunk missing.  There are comments describing the _goal_ of the missing code you need to write.
- `4_empty.py`: Your turn! Starting with a blank page, find a new _strategy_ and _implementation_ to write the same _behavior_ as the `0_reference.py`.
