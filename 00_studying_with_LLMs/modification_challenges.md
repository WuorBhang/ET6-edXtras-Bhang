> learning goals: making incremental changes to a program, and learning to imagine what a program _could_ be but isn't yet

I would like to understand this program in more depth through experimentation.  Can you suggest a collection of modification challenges I can develop, each one starting with a copy-paste of this exact code:

```py
# paste your coe here
```

---

Inspiration for the LLM:

- Include challenges that modify a program's _behavior_ and others that only modify it's _implementation_ and/or _strategy_.
- Sequence your suggestions by both complexity and scaffolding (eg. an early challenge can be more difficult it if has enough guidance).
- Indicate which skills and language features are emphasized in each refactor.
- Include some multi-step refactors with meaningful intermediate stages.
