> learning goals:  understanding a larger strategy as smaller codable goals, and translating intentions into code

I want to practice translating high-level strategies into working code.  Can you generate Python a file with detailed specs in a docstring and comments that outline what needs to be implemented, focusing on purpose rather than specific syntax? Please create 2-3 exercises with different strategies for the same behavior so I can explore their trade-offs.  I will copy-paste these files into VSCode to develop my solutions.

Inspiration for the LLM:

- There can be some boilerplate or incomplete code in the file.
- Comments should focus on the _purpose_ of the missing code, not describe what specific code should be written.
- Comments should draw attention to connections across the program.
- Comments can include study questions to deepen my engagement with the task.
