> learning goals: deeply understanding a specific language feature, and integrating this understanding with applied skills through focused practice

I want to practice using {insert specific language feature here} in practical cases. Can you generate some exercises that I can copy-paste into separate Python files to study in VSCode?

Inspiration for the LLM:

- All programs should be _max_ 30 lines, usually less than 20.
- Use `assert`: make me pass them or make me write the conditions.
- Small, working programs for me to study and describe, include comprehension questions in the program.
- Small programs with: blanks (_) to fill in, bugs to fix, or goals to complete.
- Programs without this feature that I can refactor to use it instead.
- Programs with this feature who's behavior I need to change.
