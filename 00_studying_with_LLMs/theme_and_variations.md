> learning goals: building a mental library of code to lean on, and learning how to contextually match this library to use cases.

I want to understand this program through a study of variations teasing apart the program's _behavior_, _strategy_ and _implementation_. Please generate programs based on this code that I can study side-by-side in VSCode:

```py
# paste your code here
```

Inspiration for the LLM:

- include an explanation and review of the original code without modifying it.
- Include comments that hint at what I should learn from, and questions to guide my study of each program.
- Indicate how similar each program is to the original along different dimensions.
- Fixed _behavior_ variations: programs with similar behavior but different strategies and implementations
- Fixed _strategy_ variations: programs that use similar strategies to solve different problems than the original
- Fixed _Implementation_ variations: programs that showcase language features from the original in different contexts.
- Improvements and Deprovements: programs that are intentionally better or worse than the original along different dimensions.
- !! Take inspiration from **Teaching Games: Statistical Sampling Assumptions for Learning in Pedagogical Situations** by **Patrick Shafto** and **Noah Goodman**.
