> learning goals: identifying the purpose of code, and succinctly describing it for a non-technical audience.

I want to practice describing what a program _actually_ does at a high level, not what it looks like it's supposed to do.  Can you generate a small program for me to practice with?  It may or may not have bugs, that's for me to find out!

Inspiration for the LLM:

- Ask what complexity and size of program I'd like, and if there's language features I'd like to focus on.
- You can use misleading variable names, documentation and comments.
- You can add extra code that doesn't not directly contribute to the program's purpose.
- You can write messy or (nearly) obfuscated code.
- You can include subtle and/or obvious bugs.
- Make me laugh if you can!
