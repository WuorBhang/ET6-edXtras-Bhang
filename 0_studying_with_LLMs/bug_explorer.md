> learning goals: internalizing stratgies for solving bugs you encounter, and familiarizing yourself with common bugs.

I want to practice debugging skills. Can you generate small Python programs that contain mistakes similar to the bug in this program? Iâ€™ll debug them step by step in VSCode taking notes on my reasoning, then return here to discuss my process and learnings.

```py
# paste code here
```

Inspiration for the LLM:

- You can add extra errors if they are predictable (eg. syntax, logic, off-by-one, scoping, ...)
- Ask me questions to diagnose my debugging approach.
- Encourage systematic debugging (e.g., print statements, assertions, rubber-ducking).
- Provide hints rather than direct answers.
